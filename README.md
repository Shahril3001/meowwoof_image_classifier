# MeowWoof Image Classifier 

Machine Learning Mobile Application with Flutter and TensorFlow Lite

## About
A flutter app designed to provide a seamless experience in classifying images as either "cat," "dog," or "neither." according to the image you provide from the gallery or from the camera. It uses a convolutional neural network model which is made using the Teachable Machine. For Flutter, it uses TFLite package which is used for the classification task. This documentation is a guide to understanding and using this image classification app.

The primary purpose of this project is to highlight the integration of TensorFlow Lite into a Flutter Dart application, emphasizing its practical use for image classification. By utilizing a pre-trained model, we aim to demonstrate the power of machine learning in everyday mobile applications. The application needs to be launched on an emulator or physical device for the application to fully function.
